This a to-do list for myself. However, if you are interested and have time, you are always welcome.

1. Integrate the class Function.CourseTable with Function.CourseSystem. 
2. Make TimeTable.all_t a private instance variable, and use self[i] to replace self.all_t[i]
3. Move Function.TimeTable to Tool
4. Distinguish the functions of __repr__() and that of display()
5. Add 'update file change' feature
6. Serializaiton for Function.School
